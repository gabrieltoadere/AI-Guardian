ALL THE CODE SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN THE AI GUARDIAN PROJECT FOLDER
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS JUST CREATE THE FILE YOU ARE WORKING ON AND COMMIT & PUSH AS NORMAL
THIS ALLOWS EVERYONE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL CODE AS TIME GOES ON INSTEAD OF JUST PIECES OF SOMEONES CODE


this file contains instructions for any problems we encoutner along the way that we 
need to inform the rest about, anything that doesnt have a correlation to the task you are working on 
in the main project and anything that you feel wont make sense to talk about in your push comments
